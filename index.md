## Grading

| Letter Grade | Points |
|--|--|
|A+  |  90|

### Breakdown

Total grade is broken down as follows:
- Participation (25 pts.)
  - Students must turn in comments in the form of a 100-word abstract *on the Monday of each week* and will get full credits. For *each reading*, students will write up an abstract which conforms to the BOMCR method. More information and writing examples are available [here](https://www.acgme.org/Portals/0/HowtoWriteanAbstract.pdf) and [here](http://web.mit.edu/communicate/abstracts.html).
- Quizzes: (25 pts.)
  - Students will complete the quizzes through iCollege and solutions will posted in the [Schedule](/outline.md) of the class website. Quizzes are open-book (i.e., no proctoring & consultation of web sources are allowed), each entailing 10 questions to be completed within 45 minutes. Please note that this is an extremely generous time allocation and students are likely to complete the quizzes in about half-an-hour.
- Group Project (50 pts.): refer to the [Project](/project.md) description for more information
- Bonus points (5 pts.): awarded to the members of the group winning most in-class exercises.
  - In-class exercise will be conducted in the same groups that will complete the group projects. Each team will score every other team's performance and the team ranking first overall will receive 5 points at the end of the course (i.e., each group member will add 5 bonus points to her total grade).
