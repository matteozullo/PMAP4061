## Grading

The student is graded out of 100 points and 5 bonus will be available through in-class exercises. Letter grades will be assigned as per the table below.

| Letter Grade       |              |              |             |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| A+ (98-100)        | B+ (88-89.9) | C+ (78-78.9) | D (60-69.9) |
| A (93-97.9)        | B (83-87.9)  | C (73-77.9)  | F (0-59.9)  |
| A- (90-92.9)       | B- (80.82.9) | C- (70-72.9) |             |


Total grade is broken down as follows:

#### Participation (25 pts.)
For each reading, students will write up an abstract which loosely conforms to the BOMCR method (more information and writing examples are available [here](https://www.acgme.org/Portals/0/HowtoWriteanAbstract.pdf) and [here](http://web.mit.edu/communicate/abstracts.html)). Students must turn in the abstracts as a single submission through the corresponding assignment item on iCollege. Although I will provide feedback on their work, students will be awarded full credits whenever submitting any abstract. I used the word "loosely" before because readings differ therefore different formats might be appropriate at times.

#### Quizzes (25 pts.)
Five quizzes will be issued during the semester. Students will complete the quizzes through iCollege and solutions will posted in the [Schedule](/schedule.md) of the class website. Quizzes are open-book (i.e., consultation of web sources and notes is allowed) and contain 10 questions each to be completed within 45 minutes. Please note that this is an extremely generous time allocation and students are likely to complete the quizzes in about half-an-hour. At the end of the class, quiz scores will be totaled up and curved if average class performance falls below the expected grade of B.

#### Project (50 pts.)
Please refer to the [Project](/project.md) section for more information. The project consists of a policy report and a Poster presentation to be completed in teams of three to four. Each group member will be awarded the same grade, however students who wish to complain about their group collaboration are encouraged to voice their concerns as early as possible.

#### Bonus points (2.5 pts.)
The bonus points will be awarded to the members of the group scoring the most points in in-class exercises. In-class exercise will be conducted in the same groups that will complete the group projects. Each team will score every other team's performance and the team ranking first overall will receive 2.5 points at the end of the course (i.e., each group member will add 2.5 bonus points to her total grade).

## Policies

### Late Policy
Late submissions are **wholeheartedly discouraged** but no late policy applies. Students who fail to meet deadlines must follow-up on their late submissions with an e-mail note providing a justification for the delay.

### Issues
Broader issues which affect the student performance throughout the semester – including and not limited to disability, childcare, and mental health – must be notified to the instructor **at the beginning of the semester**. Late notifications of longstanding issues might not be a reason to waive any class requirements.

### Attendance
Class attendance is **required**. Students who experience personal or work-related issues might occasionally skip class meetings. When that happens, students are reponsible for sending out an e-mail note to the instructor and encouraged to attend office hours to make up for the material.

### Withdrawal
- Students wishing to withdraw within the official deadline as per the [Academic Calendar](https://registrar.gsu.edu/registration/semester-calendars-exam-schedules/#fall-2021) might do so without receiving a grade of F.
- Students wishing to withdraw past the official deadline might do so in accordance with the [Emergency Withdrawal](https://deanofstudents.gsu.edu/student-assistance/emergency-withdrawal/) policy.

### University

- [AYSPS Career Services & Student Life Office](https://career.aysps.gsu.edu)
