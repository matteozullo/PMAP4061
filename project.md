# Project

## Description

In this project, you will be working in teams of three to four. You will craft a six-month response plan to **tackle the COVID-19 outbreak in February 2020 leading into the Fall**. You will deliver your final projects in two installments as detailed out in the section below. Your final deliverable will also include a Poster presentation to be delivered through an unlisted YouTube video.<br>
You might *loosely* follow the six steps outlined in the [Meltzer & Schwartz](https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315209678) textbook, but you will mostly have flexibility with regard to structuring your final paper. Therefore, sectioning is really up to individual groups although one candidate structure often used for policy reports is *Executive Summary* (optional), *Introduction*, *Background*, *Policy Recommendations*, *Conclusions*, Appendix (optional). An *Executive Summary* is most times perfunctuntory when your ideas have been clearly summarized in the *Conclusions*. As a matter of fact, the *Conclusions* is not a place for you to add new material but a place for yout to restate and summarize what already stated elsewhere in the write-up. Also, the *Conclusions* is where consumers of your report will likely get their eyes on first, so you really want to make it a stand out.

 The value you bring as a policy analyst is manifold:
* You critically examine qualitative and quantitative evidence from a variety of sources.
* You tie evidence back to your objective function to outline coherent response strategies.
* You acknowledge both the strengths and the limitations of your policy alternatives, your assumptions, and your model.

## Context

On February 24th, 2020 the Centers for Disease and Control Prevention (CDC) issues a statement reporting that a virus originating from Wuhan, China is sweeping through the country unchecked. Initial evidence from Chinese researchers demonstrates huge variations in clinical outcomes of patients based on age and preexisting conditions. A vaccine is currently unavailable despite the World Health Organization (WHO) reporting several vaccine candidates. As **an analyst serving for the Georgia state legislature**, you seek policy recommendations to address the pandemic within the limits of the legislature’s mandate. Your plan covers a 6-month period in a good faith attempt to uphold the public interest.

The following reads are essential starters:

## Format

Format is quite open, but you want to be within the **3,000-5,000 words range**. This range is standard for policy reports while policy briefs are on the shorter side coming in at 1,500-3,000 words. You probably want to use Microsoft Word for your final report but really any text editor (e.g., Pages) and markup language (e.g., LateX) is fair game. Adherence to the [APA style guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org) is encouraged.
You will be turning in the *Introduction* and *Background* section or the project (or whatever content which covers those if you decide to departure from the template) halfway through the semester and your final project including the Poster and the related video at the end of the course. The [Schedule](/schedule.md) section includes official due dates for the project deliverables.


## Structure

### Introduction
In this section, you define the problem statement and outline the remainder of the report. Effectively, you will reverse-engineer your literature review your policy alternatives starting from your problem statement. Hence, you must:

* Clearly spell out your **problem statement** avoiding [tautologies](https://www.britannica.com/topic/tautology).
* Comprehensively define a **public utility function** which includes variables, resources, and constraints to the public choice problem. This does not need be a mathematical presentation but a rigorous showing of your hand. 
* Carefully identify the **groups with stakes** in the outcome of the policymaking process and discuss how they are impacted.
* Succintly outline a **research plan** which will translate into a review of available evidence in the *Background* section.
* Briefly introduce the reader to the different **policy alternatives** which will be considered in the *Policy Recommendations*.

A definition of the target public utility function is integral to addressing the problem. This is because different response policies might be equally legitimate depending on your objective function. Please note that a problem definition is not a policy intervention: one problem definition might lead to multiple policy alternatives.
Furthermore, the *Introduction* is not the section where you will introduce graphs or discuss data into details. However, you might decide to mention some very important information which grabs the reader's attention. Some things you might want to consider:

* What you understand about the virus outbreak (*hint*: do the characteristics of the infection suggest any responses?)
* What the broader policy environment looks like (*hint*: do you have a timeline for the vaccine rollout?)
* What a theoretical framework for the problem definition might be (*hint*: are there externalities involved?)
* Why uncoordinated parties might or might not fail to tackle the pandemic (*hint*: why is public intervention justified?)

Try out different problem definitions and stress-test their **consistency** (i.e, whether they exhibit any logical fallacies) and **validity** (i.e., whether the underlying assumptions are strong enough).


### Background

Based on your answers to the questions above and the other questions you have figured out with your team, short-list sources for your bibliography. Ideally, you want to write your *Introduction* and *Background* sections at once as good policy analysis writing is flip-flopping from one to the other. The more you research, the more you perfect your initial problem definition by fully accounting for the scope and scale of the policy space.
Use paragraphs to break down your [single major points](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/paragraphs_and_paragraphing/index.html) and to guide the reader through your presentation. There are three types of support literature and evidence that an outstanding background section considers:

* **Theoretical work** which provides a framework to understand relationships between variables in the target policy space. These will be the likes of public good economics, behavioral social sciences, game theory, and other frameworks which will be discussed in class. For example, you will want to be well-read on informational asymmetry theory if you believe some are involved. 
* **Empirical work** which provides support to some policies predicting potential gains, costs, and unwanted consequences of policy interventions. For example, you would want to look up studies of classroom-based policies if you are to propose changes in the way instruction is delivered.
* **Data** in the form of secondary data and, more rarely, primary data, which informs your response plan. For example, you would definitely want to know something about distribution of income across and within social groups if you are to impose restrictions on the economic activity.

### Policy Recommendations
You will:
* **Identify at least three policy interventions** including a “no intervention” scenario. Give a succinct presentation of the alternatives outlining their strengths and weaknesses based on the best available evidence. Please note that a policy intervention is not a program. One policy intervention might occasionally boil down to a program but most often include one or more programs, legislative action, and budget allocations. The difference between a policy and a program as tools of public policy is the same difference between policy evaluation and program evaluation as academic disciplines.
* **Score your policy alternatives** using qualitative or quantitative methods of choosing. One such method must involve some financial analysis from the cost numbers you compiled (include as a separate spreadsheet). This might be a full-blown cost-benefit analysis or a quick-and-dirty cost-benefit measure. Sometimes, a policy alternative dominate rival policies by orders of magnitude, in which case a cost-benefit analysis might be totally unnecessary. Explain what you are doing and list any assumptions. A Goeller scorecard display of your alternatives and criteria may be be useful to summarize the information.
* **Propose one of the intereventions for adoption** from the state legislature. If you think two or more policy alternatives are equally viable and prefer not to take a stand, that is also fine as long as you argue for your position.

One good way of thinking of policy recommendations is that to ask yourself three questions:
* Have I considered the policy space in full or am I giving a full answer to what is a partial definition of the problem? You want your presentation to be **comprehensive**. 
* Will my presentation withstand the most likely challenges from the audience? You want your presentation to be **coherent**.
* Will my policy recommendations fall flat or will they call for immediate action? You want your presentation to be **actionable**.

### Conclusions
This section will not introduce new information but **restate your main points** and the call for action. Please note that most non-academic readers will start or even limit their reading time to your *Conclusions*. Therefore, it is paramount to keep the delivery crisp and clear. There will likely be no need for an *Executive Summary* if your *Conclusions* section is a good wrap-up for your policy report. Different policy analysts tend to use one or the other, and often times featuring both might only add redundancies to a report.

  

## Presentation

You will be creating a Poster for your presentation and create a **5-min video** in which you go over the Poster and present its content in a compelling way. You will upload it through a Google account as un [unlisted YouTube video](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) and turn in the URL link from YouTube on iCollege. Luckily, uploading video is an extremely easy process on YouTube (more information [here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57407?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)). A lower-resolution video will be ready before the 4K version of the video has been uploaded (more information [here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/71674?hl=en)). Please do the waiting and turn in a 4K video because the difference in quality is sensible although turning in a lower-resolution video will not impact on your grade. Unlisted videos might only be accessed by those possessing the link, hence this upload process does not expose your work and intellectual property to any external viewers.
Recording a short video is a very good exercise for you to work on your ability to condense down complex policy messages. Here are some suggestions for the Poster and video deliverables:
- You will find plenty of Poster templates online such as [this one](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/public-health-practice-resources-old/practice-information/student-posters/examples-of-posters/) from Harvard School of Public Health. You might want to use [Google Drawings](https://docs.google.com/drawings) to create your poster or other software of your choosing. The suggested dimensions for your poster are 48-inch width and 36-inch height in portrait or landscape orientation. The use of font size 18 or larger is highly recommended.
- Because 5 minutes is a limited amount of time that you have to explain your ideas, you will need to select the information you present (you will hopefully abide by Simon's satisficing principle and other behavioral principles). You might want to write copy beforehand so that filler words such as "so", "uhm", and likes will not be all over your presentation.

  

## Grading

The content of your write-up will not be a factor in the grading. You will be graded against:
* [~25%] The completeness of your project as per the requirements outlined above.
* [~25%] The selection and discussion of evidence.
* [~25%] Thoroughness of your problem statement and policy alternative definitions.
* [~25%] The quality of your writing and presentation.

*Hint*: none of the words in boldface in this section is bold-faced by chance. Think of them as a checklist albeit a flexible one.

The Poster presentation will be evaluated against:
* [-50%] The poster design must be well-thought. Sectioning must be easy on the eyes and use of texts minimized. If you have good graphs or visuals, the Poster is their chance to shine. You will not be writing full sentences because the video and audio inputs would otherwise neutralize. Instead, you will use texts as visual cues for the audience to keep up with your presentation. Grammar and spelling mistakes must be avoided.
* [-50%] Presentation delivery must be compelling. You do not want to rush through your presentation as that will indicate that you have packed it with too much content and did not select the most important takeaways. A 4-min video with no rushing dominates a 5-min video where you rush through your final four or five sentences. It is totally fine to use social science vocabulary as long as you explain what you are talking about. It is a huge misconception that avoiding big words is a marker for clarity. It is not. The flow of ideas is what makes or breaks a presentation. Therefore, careful selection of content including mentions of data points and evidence, clear organization of your arguments in a syllogistic form ("A implies B, and we observe A so..."), and clarity of delivery are all factors in your grade.
