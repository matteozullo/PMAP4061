# Project

## Description

In this project, you will be working in teams of three to four. You will craft a six-month response plan to **tackle the COVID-19 outbreak in February 2020 leading into the Fall**. You will deliver your final projects in four installments as detailed out in the section below.<br>
The final report will follow the structure most commonly used for policy reports including an *Introduction*, a *Background* section, the *Policy Recommendations*, the *Conclusions*, and an *Appendix* (optional). The deliverable is also broken out into four subdeliverables although they do not match the four sections to the final report. Effectively, the *Conclusions* is not a place for you to add new materials but a place for you to restate and summarize the content of the write-up. This is the section where consumers of your report will likely get their eyes on first, so you really want to make it a stand out.

The value you bring as a policy analyst is manifold:
* You critically examine qualitative and quantitative evidence from a variety of sources.
* You tie evidence back to your objective function to outline coherent response strategies.
* You acknowledge both the strengths and the limitations of your policy alternatives, your assumptions, and your evaluation model.

## Context

On February 24th, 2020 the Centers for Disease and Control Prevention (CDC) issues a statement reporting that a virus originating from Wuhan, China is sweeping through the country unchecked. Initial evidence from Chinese researchers demonstrates huge variations in clinical outcomes of patients based on age and preexisting conditions. A vaccine is currently unavailable despite the World Health Organization (WHO) reporting several vaccine candidates. As **an analyst serving for the Georgia state legislature**, you seek policy recommendations to address the pandemic within the limits of the legislature’s mandate. Your plan covers a 6-month period (i.e., Spring & Summer 2020) in a good faith attempt to uphold the public interest leading into the Fall.

The following reads are essential starters:

## Format

You will want to be within the **3,000-5,000 words range** for your final report. This range is standard for policy reports while policy briefs are on the shorter side coming in at 1,500-3,000 words. You probably want to use Microsoft Word for your write-up but really any text editor (e.g., Pages) and markup language (e.g., LateX) is fair game. Adherence to the [APA style guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org) is encouraged.
There will be four deliverables associated with your project which will be graded cumulatively. That means, the instructor will give out suggestions on how to improve the write-up at any stage and teams will turn in the new deliverable plus the edits to prior parts of the report. Thus, the project will build up through a trial-and-error process which elicits incremental improvements. This is also the reason why the last submission carries more weight than each of the prior submissions.

### Deliverables

- **I: Problem Statement** [10 pts.]. Teams will submit a problem statement consisting of a few paragraphs of no more than 500 words. Because of its bearing on the whole report, teams will receive early feedback on their problem statement definitions. At this stage, they will not have to bother fitting the problem statement into a full-fledged *Introduction* section as this will be required for the next step.
- **II: Introduction** [10 pts.]. This deliverable consists of the *Introduction* section inclusive of the problem statement and the three pieces described into more details below: *a*) analysis of interest groups, *b*) public utility function definition, and *c*) research plan outline. Teams will take on from their problem statement definition, make any changes as per the instructor's suggestions, and put together the rest of *Introduction*. Clearly, the bibliography and policy alternative definitions might be tentative at this stage therefore teams should not worry too much about them. The goal is to start thinking organically about the report and connecting the different dots. The recommended word count for this section is anywhere between 800-1,500 words but teams should by no means see the word count as a target.
- **III: Background** [10 pts.]. The suggested approach is to work through this deliverable in pieces. Ideally, teams will want to write up a list of sources that will be making up their *Background* section. They are encouraged to compile their bibliography in a text file and submit it to the instructor for review. Although there is no set number which fulfills this requirement, 10 cites is probably too little and 30 cites might be overreaching. As an additional rule-of-thumb, teams might want to include at least 5-10 academic references, 5-10 high-quality industry or nonprofit references, and 5 data points collected from newspaper articles, surveys, open data sources, etc. The write-up will summarize the takeaways from the listed sources in an original, organic, and coherent fashion that speaks to the problem statement definition. A length of 1,000-2,000 words is appropriate for this section.
- **IV: Policy Recommendations and Conclusions** [20 pts.]. The final deliverable will cover the *Policy Recommendations* and *Conclusions* sections, thus the final version of the report must be submitted at this stage. The *Conclusions* will add nothing to the content presented in the report and the writing should not take very long. If your team is stuck stringing together the *Conclusions*, that probably indicates that some of the information has been omitted from the body of the report. While the structure is quite flexible, teams are required to recognize at least three intervention scenarios (one of which is the “no intervention” option), discuss their advantages and disadvantages, and score the policy alternatives using a Goeller scorecard display. The completely non-binding expected word count for this section is in the 1,500-2,500 range.

### Fair Collaboration
Teams will gloss each submission with a note breaking down individual contributions to the deliverable (e.g., student A did X,Y,Z). The note shall also state that "each team member has contributed fairly to the group project" and will go in a footnote or in a *Collaboration* section at the end of the file which will not count towards the word limit.<br>
It is within expectations that some students will want to put in extra effort because of their interest in the project, or that some students who are better at writing might be less inclined to data analysis. What matters is that everyone brings her fair contribution to the project, where the threshold for "fair" has to be aggreed upon by the team members. If collaboration falls apart or some team members are pushing the threshold for "unfair" too hard, teams should reach to the instructor as soon as possible.

## Structure

### Introduction
In this section, you define the problem statement and outline the remainder of the report. You will be effectively reverse-engineering your literature review and policy alternatives starting from your problem statement, therefore a good *Introduction* section is the hallmark of a good policy report. You must:

* Clearly spell out the **problem statement** avoiding tautologies.
* Comprehensively define a **public utility function** which includes variables, resources, and constraints to the public choice problem. This does not need be a mathematical presentation but a rigorous showing of your hand. 
* Carefully identify the **groups with stakes** in the outcome of the policymaking process and discuss how they might be impacted.
* Succintly outline the **research plan** which will translate into a review of evidence in the *Background* section.
* Briefly introduce the reader to the different **policy alternatives** which will be considered in the *Policy Recommendations*.

A definition of the target public utility function is integral to addressing the problem. This is because different response policies might be equally legitimate depending on your objective function. Please note that a problem definition is not a policy intervention: one problem definition might lead to multiple policy alternatives. Furthermore, the *Introduction* is not the section where you will introduce graphs or discuss data into details; however, you might decide to mention some very important information which grabs the reader's attention. Some things you might want to consider:

* What you understand about the virus outbreak (*hint*: do the characteristics of the infection suggest any responses?)
* What the broader policy environment looks like (*hint*: do you have a timeline for the vaccine rollout?)
* What a theoretical framework for the problem definition might be (*hint*: are there externalities involved?)
* Why uncoordinated private parties might or might not fail to tackle the pandemic (*hint*: why is public intervention justified?)

Try out different problem definitions and stress-test their consistency (i.e, whether they exhibit any logical fallacies) and validity (i.e., whether the underlying assumptions are strong enough).


### Background

Based on your answers to the questions above and the other questions you have figured out with your teams, short-list sources for your bibliography. Ideally, you will want to write your *Introduction* and *Background* sections at once as good policy analysis writing is flip-flopping from one to the other. The more you research, the more you perfect your initial problem definition by fully accounting for the scope and scale of the policy space.
Use paragraphs to break down your writing into [single major points](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/paragraphs_and_paragraphing/index.html) and to pace the reader through the presentation. There are three types of support literature and evidence that an outstanding background section shall consider:

* **Theoretical work** which provides a framework to understand relationships between variables in the target policy space. These will be the likes of public good economics, behavioral social sciences, game theory, and other frameworks which are discussed in class. For example, you will want to be well-read on informational asymmetry theory if you believe some are involved.
* **Empirical work** which supports or discourages policy interventions based on their potential gains, costs, and unwanted consequences. For example, you will want to look up studies of classroom-based policies if you are to propose changes in the way instruction is being delivered.
* **Data** in the form of secondary data and, more rarely, primary data, which informs your response plan. For example, you will want to know something about distribution of income across and within social groups if you are to impose restrictions on the economic activity.

### Policy Recommendations
You will:
* **Identify at least three policy interventions including a “no intervention” scenario**. Give a succinct presentation of the alternatives outlining their strengths and weaknesses based on the best available evidence. Please note that a policy intervention is not a program. One policy intervention might occasionally boil down to a single program but most often encompasses one or more programs, multiple pieces of legislation, and several budget allocations. The difference between a policy and a program as tools of public policy is the same difference there is between policy evaluation and program evaluation as academic disciplines.
* **Score your policy alternatives**. A Goeller scorecard display of your alternatives and criteria must be provided to summarize the information. The suggestion here is to start with Goeller and write up your *Policy Recommendations* section as you walk the reader through the scorecard explaining any assumptions. You can definitely perform a cost-benefit analysis but this is not required. However, you must qualify your statements with cost-benefit measures such as the per-unit benefit of every $1 spent on the policy or their measurable impacts on individual wellbeing. For example, a policy involving remote instruction should include its educational cost by measure of achievement gap (i.e., how much worse or better students are expected to perform under the proposed configuration). Sometimes, one policy alternative dominates rival policies by orders of magnitude, in which case a full-blown cost-benefit analysis is totally unnecessary.
* **Propose one of the intereventions for adoption from the state legislature**. If you think two or more policy alternatives are equally viable and prefer not to take a stand, that is also fine as long as you argue for your position.

One good way of thinking of policy recommendations is asking yourself a set of questions:
* Have I considered the policy space in full or am I giving a full answer to what is a partial definition of the policy problem? In other words, you want your presentation to be **comprehensive**.
* Will my presentation withstand the most likely challenges from the audience? In other words, you want your presentation to be **coherent**.
* Will my policy recommendations fall flat? In other words, you want your presentation to be **actionable**.

### Conclusions
This section will not introduce new information but **restate your main points** and embolden the **call for action**. Please note that most non-academic readers will start or even limit their reading time to the *Conclusions*, therefore it is paramount to keep the delivery crisp and clear. As a side-benefit, there will be no need for an *Executive Summary* if the *Conclusions* section is a good enough wrap-up for the policy report. Different policy analysts tend to use one or the other, and often times reports which feature both would end up adding redundancies to the writing.


## Grading

The content of your write-up will not be a factor in the grading. You will be graded against:
* [~25%] The completeness of your project as per the requirements outlined above. Following is a checklist of the materials to be included:
    * *Introduction*: Problem statement, stakeholder analysis, public utility function, research plan
    * *Background*: Theoretical literature, empirical literature, data sources
    * *Policy Recommendations*: Intervention scenarios, policy recommendation, Goeller scorecard
    * *Conclusions*: Summary of main points, call for action
* [~15%] The selection and discussion of evidence.
    * [~5%] Are the sources reputable and relevant?
    * [~5%] Are the different aspects of your response plan (economic, educational, public health, etc.) covered?
    * [~5%] Are the references coherently tied together and back to the problem statement?
* [~30%] Thoroughness of your presentation.
    * [~7.5%] Does your problem statement cover the "5Ws"?
    * [~7.5%] Do you adequately characterize the policy space (first principles, objective function, resources, variables, constraints)?
    * [~7.5%] Are your policy alternatives mutually exclusive, non-overlapping, and collectively exhaustive of what might be done?
    * [~7.5%] Are you using appropriate quantifications and citations to justify your policy alternatives?
* [~30%] The quality of your writing and presentation.
    * [~15%] Do you avoid any tautologies and logical fallacies?
    * [~7.5%] Is your use of paragraphation and single major points conducive to reading?
    * [~7.5%] Do you draw from the policy analysis vocabulary and lingua?

*Hint*: none of the words in boldface in this section is bold-faced by chance. Intermediate deliverables will be graded against partial versions of the rubric above.
